I"C<h1 id="biography">Biography</h1>
<p>I am an undergraduate student in Artificial Intelligence and Automation at <strong>Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)</strong>. I am advised by Professor Dongrui Wu and research in machine learning and brain-computer interface in his lab. I have received th offer of CSST summer intern at <strong>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</strong>.</p>

<p>My interest lies in the field of <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Biological information processing</strong>. <a href="./assets/cv/ShaozheHao_CV.pdf">[CV]</a></p>

<p><strong><font size="4">Car License Plate Precise Detection </font></strong>                     <br />
<em>Vizum, Beijing, China</em></p>

<p>I was an intern in <strong>Vizum</strong>, a company focusing on computer vision in industrial application. In Vizum, I developed a system dependently, which could detect car license plates sharply, regardless of angle, lighting, cover or other noises and draw the line along the contour of plates. The techniques I used are YOLO, a deep learning network for Object Detection, and traditional image processing methods for sharp contour extraction.</p>

<p><strong><font size="4">EEG-Based Individual Identification and Verification </font></strong>                       <em>HUST, Wuhan, China</em></p>

<p>The focus of this research is to use machine learning and signal processing techniques to identify and verify people by their Electroencephalogram (EEG). I used Common Spatial Pattern and CNN ( Convolutional Neural Network) to realize feature extraction and classification algorithm for the time series. For single time domain, the accuracy can reach nearly 98%.</p>
