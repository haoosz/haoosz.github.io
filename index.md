# Biography

I am an undergraduate student in Artificial Intelligence and Automation at **Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**. I am advised by Professor Dongrui Wu and research in machine learning and brain-computer interface in his lab. I have received th offer of CSST summer intern at **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**. 

My interest lies in the field of **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning** and **Biological information processing**. [[CV]](./assets/cv/ShaozheHao_CV.pdf)

# Projects

**Car License Precise Detection **                 
*Vizum, Beijing, China*

I was an intern in **Vizum**, a company focusing on computer vision in industrial application. In Vizum, I developed a system dependently, which could detect car license plates sharply, regardless of angle, lighting, cover or other noises and draw the line along the contour of plates. The techniques I used are YOLO, a deep learning network for Object Detection, and traditional image processing methods for sharp contour extraction.

**EEG-Based Individual Identification and Verification **       
*HUST, Wuhan, China*

The focus of this research is to use machine learning and signal processing techniques to identify and verify people by their Electroencephalogram (EEG). I used Common Spatial Pattern and CNN ( Convolutional Neural Network) to realize feature extraction and classification algorithm for the time series. For single time domain, the accuracy can reach nearly 98%.
